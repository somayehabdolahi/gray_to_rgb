Autoencoder with CIFAR-10 Dataset


This repository contains a Python script that implements an Autoencoder model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The Autoencoder is trained to reconstruct 
grayscale images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The code utilizes TensorFlow and OpenCV for deep learning and image processing tasks.
